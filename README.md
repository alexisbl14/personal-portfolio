# Personal Website
I created this website using a tutorial from webdecoded on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/hYv6BM2fWd8?si=5vJdt662L2fAPW-f)

Instead of just React, I used Vite for better performance.

I also adjusted many of the designs that were in the original video, and added some simple animations. I created a more descriptive project section that includes an intuitive drop down menu that describes more about the project.

I hope you enjoy going through my portfolio!
